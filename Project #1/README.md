Python/Jupyter Lab Data Extraction Tutorial
===========================================

This tutorial demonstrates how to extract data from CSV files and PDF tables from websites using Python and Jupyter Lab. We'll be using pandas, Tkinter, Ghostscript, and Camelot.py for this purpose.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   Python (version 3.x recommended)
*   Jupyter Lab
*   pandas
*   Tkinter (usually included with Python)
*   Ghostscript
*   Camelot.py

You can install Python and Jupyter Lab using Anaconda or directly from their respective websites. For other packages, you can use pip:

bash

Copy code

`pip install pandas pip install ghostscript pip install camelot-py[cv]`

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open Jupyter Lab.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded this repository.
4.  Open the Jupyter notebook file `data_extraction.ipynb`.

Extracting CSV Files
--------------------

To extract data from CSV files, follow these steps:

1.  Use the pandas library to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2.  Perform any necessary data cleaning or manipulation.
3.  Save the extracted data to a new CSV file if needed.

Here's a sample code snippet:


`import pandas as pd  # Read CSV file into a DataFrame data = pd.read_csv('example.csv')  # Perform data cleaning or manipulation # For example: # data_cleaned = ...  # Save extracted data to a new CSV file if needed # data_cleaned.to_csv('extracted_data.csv', index=False)`

Extracting PDF Tables
---------------------

To extract tables from PDF files on websites, we'll use Camelot.py along with Ghostscript. Follow these steps:

1.  Use Camelot.py to extract tables from the PDF.
2.  Convert the extracted tables into pandas DataFrames.
3.  Perform any necessary data cleaning or manipulation.
4.  Display or save the extracted data as needed.

Here's a sample code snippet:



`import camelot  # Use Camelot.py to extract tables from PDF tables = camelot.read_pdf('example.pdf', flavor='stream')  # Convert tables into pandas DataFrames dfs = [table.df for table in tables]  # Perform data cleaning or manipulation # For example: # cleaned_data = ...  # Display or save the extracted data as needed # cleaned_data.to_csv('extracted_data.csv', index=False)`

Conclusion
----------

In this tutorial, we've learned how to extract data from CSV files and PDF tables from websites using Python and Jupyter Lab. By leveraging libraries like pandas, Tkinter, Ghostscript, and Camelot.py, you can efficiently extract and analyze data for various purposes.
